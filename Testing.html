Last Friday’s testing environment was not acceptable. Too much talking, movement, and lack of focus took away from the purpose of testing. From now on, our testing expectations will be strictly enforced.

During any test or quiz on your Chromebook (Google Form):
	1.	Absolute Silence – No talking, whispering, or unnecessary noise.
	2.	Eyes on Your Own Screen – Stay focused only on your Chromebook.
	3.	Do Not Exit the Form – If I see that you leave the quiz and re-enter, your test will be given a zero.
	4.	No Phones or Other Tabs – Only the Google Form is allowed to be open.
	5.	Stay Seated and Respectful – Do not distract yourself or others.

Academic Integrity:
The most important rule is academic integrity. Your grade must represent your own knowledge and effort. If you talk, share answers, look at someone else’s screen, or leave the quiz to open anything else, you are breaking that trust. Any violation will result in your test being invalidated and a zero being recorded.

Why This Matters:
I expect better because I know you are capable of better. Testing is not just about grades — it’s about honesty, respect, and discipline. These values will serve you far beyond this classroom. I want every one of you to succeed, but you can only do that through your own work.
